title: "MotherDuck Data to Posit Connect Pin Updater"
format: html

This Quarto document contains an R script designed to retrieve data from a specified table in MotherDuck and update a corresponding pin on Posit Connect. This provides a robust and automated way to feed data to your Shiny applications.

The script uses environment variables for sensitive information (MotherDuck token, Posit Connect API key), which is a best practice for secure deployment.

## R Script for Data Update

The following R code chunk performs the core logic:
1.  Connects to MotherDuck using a service token.
2.  Queries the specified table to retrieve the latest data.
3.  Connects to Posit Connect and updates the designated pin with the new data.

```{r}
# Install and load necessary R packages if not already installed
# install.packages(c("duckdb", "DBI", "pins", "dplyr"))
library(duckdb)       # For connecting to MotherDuck
library(DBI)          # Database interface for R
library(pins)         # For interacting with Posit Connect pins
library(dplyr)        # For general data manipulation (optional)

# --- Configuration (Load from Environment Variables for Security) ---
# It is CRUCIAL to store sensitive information like tokens and API keys
# as environment variables on Posit Connect, not directly in the script.

# MotherDuck Configuration
# Ensure MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN is set on Posit Connect
MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN <- Sys.getenv("MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN")
MOTHERDUCK_TABLE_NAME <- Sys.getenv("MOTHERDUCK_TABLE_NAME", "medmodus_data")

# Posit Connect Pin Configuration
# These are typically automatically picked up by 'pins' if set on Connect,
# but explicitly defining them ensures clarity.
CONNECT_SERVER_URL <- Sys.getenv("CONNECT_SERVER_URL")
CONNECT_API_KEY <- Sys.getenv("CONNECT_API_KEY")
PIN_NAME <- Sys.getenv("PIN_NAME", "medmodus_trolleygar_data") # Name of the pin to update

# --- Main Script Logic ---
update_pin_from_motherduck <- function() {
  message("Starting data update process from MotherDuck...")

  if (MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN == "") {
    stop("MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN environment variable is not set. Please configure it on Posit Connect.")
  }
  
  # 1. Connect to MotherDuck
  con <- NULL # Initialize connection object to NULL
  tryCatch({
    message("Connecting to MotherDuck...")
    # Construct the MotherDuck connection string with the token
    con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), 
                     paste0("md:?token=", MOTHERDUCK_TOKEN))
    message("Successfully connected to MotherDuck.")
  }, error = function(e) {
    stop(paste0("Error connecting to MotherDuck: ", e$message))
  })

  # 2. Retrieve Data from MotherDuck
  df_motherduck <- NULL # Initialize data frame object to NULL
  tryCatch({
    query <- paste0("SELECT * FROM ", MOTHERDUCK_TABLE_NAME)
    message(paste0("Executing query: ", query))
    df_motherduck <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
    message(paste0("Successfully retrieved data from table '", MOTHERDUCK_TABLE_NAME, "'."))
    message("Retrieved DataFrame head:")
    print(head(df_motherduck))
  }, error = function(e) {
    stop(paste0("Error retrieving data from MotherDuck: ", e$message))
  }) finally({
    # Ensure the connection is closed, regardless of success or failure
    if (!is.null(con) && dbIsValid(con)) {
      dbDisconnect(con, shutdown = TRUE)
      message("MotherDuck connection closed.")
    }
  })

  # 3. Connect to Posit Connect Board and Update Pin
  tryCatch({
    message(paste0("Connecting to Posit Connect server: ", CONNECT_SERVER_URL))
    
    # Initialize the Posit Connect board
    # The pins package will automatically use CONNECT_API_KEY and CONNECT_SERVER_URL
    # from environment variables if they are set.
    board <- board_connect(
      server = CONNECT_SERVER_URL,
      key = CONNECT_API_KEY
    )
    message("Successfully connected to Posit Connect board.")

    message(paste0("Updating pin: '", PIN_NAME, "'"))
    # Write the data frame to the pin.
    board %>% pin_write(
      x = df_motherduck,
      name = PIN_NAME,
      description = paste0("Data from MotherDuck table '", MOTHERDUCK_TABLE_NAME, "'"),
      type = "csv", 
      # versioned = TRUE # Uncomment if you want to keep multiple versions of the pin
    )
    message(paste0("Pin '", PIN_NAME, "' updated successfully on Posit Connect."))

  }, error = function(e) {
    stop(paste0("Error updating Posit Connect pin: ", e$message))
  })

  message("Data update process completed.")
}


  update_pin_from_motherduck()
